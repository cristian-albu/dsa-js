// In the kingdom of bubbles, you are tasked with sorting an array of natural numbers using Bubble Sort.
// Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
// The pass through the array is repeated until the array is sorted.
// For example, given [4, 2, 7, 1], the output should be [1, 2, 4, 7].
export function bubbleSort(numbers: number[]): number[] {
  // Your code here
}

// In the land of cards, you are given an array of natural numbers.
// Your task is to sort this array using Insertion Sort, a method that works similarly
// to how you might sort playing cards in your hand.
// The algorithm builds the sorted array one item at a time, inserting elements
// into their correct position by shifting larger elements to the right.
// For example, given [4, 2, 7, 1], the output should be [1, 2, 4, 7].
export function insertionSort(numbers: number[]): number[] {
  // Your code here
}

// In a chaotic world of randomness, you are given an array of natural numbers.
// Your task is to sort this array using Bogo Sort, an extremely inefficient sorting algorithm.
// Bogo Sort works by repeatedly shuffling the array randomly and checking if it is sorted.
// If the array is not sorted, the process continues until it is eventually sorted.
// For example, given [4, 2, 7, 1], after random shuffles, the output will eventually be [1, 2, 4, 7].
// WARNING: This algorithm is purely for fun and is not suitable for real-world use due to its inefficiency.
export function bogoSort(numbers: number[]): number[] {
  // Your code here
}

// In a hall of careful selections, you are given an array of natural numbers.
// Your task is to sort this array using Selection Sort.
// The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion
// of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element, thus growing the sorted portion.
// For example, given [4, 2, 7, 1], the output should be [1, 2, 4, 7].
export function selectionSort(numbers: number[]): number[] {
  // Your code here
}

// In a realm of merging, you are given an array of natural numbers.
// Your task is to sort this array using Merge Sort, a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
// Merge Sort works by dividing the array into two halves, recursively sorting them,
// and then merging the sorted halves into a single sorted array.
// For example, given [4, 2, 7, 1], the output should be [1, 2, 4, 7].
export function mergeSort(numbers: number[]): number[] {
  // Your code here
}

// In the realm of quickness, you are given an array of natural numbers.
// Your task is to sort this array using Quick Sort, a highly efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm.
// Quick Sort works by selecting a 'pivot' element, partitioning the array into elements
// less than and greater than the pivot, and then recursively sorting the partitions.
// For example, given [4, 2, 7, 1], the output should be [1, 2, 4, 7].
export function quickSort(numbers: number[]): number[] {
  // Your code here
}

// In a treasure trove of numbers, you are given an array of natural numbers with n elements.
// Your task is to find and display the values in the array that are divisible by 10,
// sorted in descending order. If there are no such values, return an empty array.
// For example, given [30, 15, 20, 5, 40], the output should be [40, 30, 20].
export function displayDescendingDivisibleByTen(numbers: number[]): number[] {
  // Your code here
}

// In a mystical forest of distinct natural numbers, you are given an array with n elements.
// Your task is to sort the elements of the array in a special way:
// all the elements before the maximum value should be sorted in ascending order,
// and all the elements after the maximum value should be sorted in descending order.
// The maximum value itself should remain in its original position.
// For example, given [3, 5, 2, 8, 1, 4], the output should be [2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 1].
// Note that 8 is the maximum value and remains in its position.
export function sortAroundMaximum(numbers: number[]): number[] {
  // Your code here
}

// In a land of numbers, you are given an array of natural numbers.
// Your task is to calculate the median of the array.
// The median is the middle value when the numbers are sorted in ascending order.
// If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.
// For example, given [3, 1, 2, 5], the output should be 2.5 (the average of 2 and 3).
export function calculateMedian(numbers: number[]): number {
  // Your code here
}

// In a valley of numbers, you are given an array of natural numbers.
// Your task is to sort the elements of the array that lie between the maximum value and the minimum value in ascending order.
// The maximum and minimum values themselves should remain in their original positions.
// For example, given [3, 5, 2, 8, 1, 4], the output should be [3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8].
// Note that 8 is the maximum and 1 is the minimum, and the elements between them (2, 4) are sorted.
export function sortBetweenMaxAndMin(numbers: number[]): number[] {
  // Your code here
}
