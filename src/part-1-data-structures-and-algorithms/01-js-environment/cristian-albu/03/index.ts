// 1. A mathematician is investigating perfect numbers.
// She needs to determine if a number is a perfect number.
// A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors.
// Can you help her confirm if the given number is a perfect number?

// 2. In a treasure hunt, players are given clues in the form of two coordinates
// (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The players need to calculate the distance
// from the origin (0,0) to each of the points. The one with the farthest distance
// wins the prize. Can you assist them in finding the maximum distance from the origin?

// 3. A statistician is analyzing two numbers representing the count of elements.
// He wants to determine the median of the two numbers without using arrays.
// Can you help him calculate the median of the two numbers?

// 4. A cryptographer is working on a secret message represented as a string.
// She wants to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters,
// but she needs to process one character at a time. Can you help her determine this length?

// 5. A computer scientist is studying a specific pattern in two numbers
// representing values in a sequence. She wants to determine the longest increasing
// sequence of numbers between the two values, one being the start and the other the end.
// Can you help her find the length of this increasing sequence?

export function lengthOfLongestIncreasingSubsequence(start: number, end: number): number {
