// In a land of integers, you are given an array of numbers.
// Your task is to determine if any value appears more than once in the array.
// Return true if there are duplicates, otherwise return false.
// For example, given [1, 2, 3, 1], the output should be true,
// since the number 1 appears more than once.
export function containsDuplicate(nums: number[]): boolean {
  // Your code here
}

// In a realm of letters, two strings are given.
// Your task is to determine if the two strings are anagrams of each other.
// An anagram consists of the same characters in a different order.
// For example, given "listen" and "silent", the output should be true,
// since both strings contain the same characters.
export function isAnagram(s: string, t: string): boolean {
  // Your code here
}

// In a bustling marketplace of numbers, you are given an array of integers
// and a target sum. Your task is to find the indices of the two numbers
// that add up to the target.
// For example, given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15] and target = 9,
// the output should be [0, 1], since nums[0] + nums[1] = 9.
export function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
  // Your code here
}

// In a village of words, you have an array of strings.
// Your task is to group all the anagrams together into sublists.
// For example, given ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
// the output could be [["bat"], ["nat", "tan"], ["ate", "eat", "tea"]].
export function groupAnagrams(strs: string[]): string[][] {
  // Your code here
}

// In a bustling market of numbers, you need to find the most frequent elements.
// Given an array of integers and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements.
// For example, given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3] and k = 2,
// the output should be [1, 2], as 1 appears three times and 2 appears twice.
export function topKFrequent(nums: number[], k: number): number[] {
  // Your code here
}

// In a world of secrets, you have a list of strings that need to be encoded
// into a single string. Your task is to design an algorithm to encode and
// decode the list back to its original form.
// For example, given ["Hello", "World"], the encoded string might be "Hello|World",
// and decoding it should return ["Hello", "World"].
export function encode(strings: string[]): string {
  // Your code here
}

export function decode(encodedString: string): string[] {
  // Your code here
}

// In a land of numbers, you are given an array of integers.
// Your task is to return an array where each element is the product of all the
// elements in the original array except itself.
// For example, given nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], the output should be [24, 12, 8, 6].
// Follow-up: Can you solve it in O(n) time without using the division operation?
export function productExceptSelf(nums: number[]): number[] {
  // Your code here
}

// In the kingdom of Sudoku, you are given a 9 x 9 board.
// Your task is to determine if the board is valid according to the Sudoku rules:
// Each row, each column, and each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes must contain the digits 1-9 without duplicates.
// For example, given a valid board, the output should be true;
// for an invalid board, the output should be false.
export function isValidSudoku(board: string[][]): boolean {
  // Your code here
}

// In a vast expanse of numbers, you are given an array of integers.
// Your task is to return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements.
// A consecutive sequence consists of elements where each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element.
// For example, given nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the output should be 4,
// since the longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].
export function longestConsecutive(nums: number[]): number {
  // Your code here
}
