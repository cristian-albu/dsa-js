# Part 1: Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript/TypeScript

## Methodology and structure:

1. Get the book "Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript" by Michael McMillan.
2. Read one chapter at a time.
3. Create a branch and copy the exercises into a new directory with your name
4. Solve all of the exercises.
5. If there are no tests you should write them.

Notes: Each exercise should be attempted for at least 20-30 minutes before looking at the chapter examples. Only after another 20-30 minutes of struggle you should look for outside help (stackoverflow, friends?, chatgpt, etc...)
