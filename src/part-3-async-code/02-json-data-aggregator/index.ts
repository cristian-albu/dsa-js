/*
Asynchronous JSON Data Aggregator
Overview
Build a script that aggregates data from multiple local JSON files, combining them into a single dataset. 
This project will help you practice managing multiple asynchronous tasks.

Key Features
Load multiple JSON files asynchronously (you can simulate multiple files with different paths).
Aggregate the data (e.g., summing values, counting occurrences).
Output the aggregated results.
