/*
Searchable and Filterable Data Grid
Overview
Create a script that loads a dataset from a local JSON file and implements a 
searchable and filterable data grid. Users can search for items, and as they type, 
the displayed results update asynchronously. This project will help you gain hands-on 
experience with debouncing, asynchronous data fetching, and state management.

Key Features
Load Data: Fetch data from a local JSON file asynchronously.
Search Functionality: Allow users to type in a search box to filter results in real-time.
Debouncing: Implement a debouncing mechanism to optimize the search input handling.
Filter by Category: Allow users to filter results based on a predefined category.
Display Results: Log the results to the console.
