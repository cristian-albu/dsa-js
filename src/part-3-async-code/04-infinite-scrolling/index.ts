Infinite Scrolling Functionality
Overview
Create a script that loads items from a local JSON file and implements infinite scrolling. 
As the user scrolls down, more items are loaded automatically without needing to click on a "Load More" button.

Key Features
Load Initial Data: Fetch a fixed number of items from a local JSON file.
Infinite Scroll Logic: Detect when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page and load more items automatically.
Simulated Delay: Use a delay to mimic the asynchronous loading of data.
Throttling: Implement a throttling mechanism to avoid loading too many times during rapid scroll events.
Data Cleanup: Remove any event listeners when no more data is available.
