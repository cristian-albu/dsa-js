/*
Mock Pagination Functionality
Overview
In this project, you will simulate pagination for a dataset stored in a local JSON file. 
The goal is to load a specific number of items (e.g., users, products) per "page" and 
implement navigation between pages asynchronously.

Key Features
Load Data: Fetch data from a local JSON file asynchronously.
Pagination Logic: Define the number of items per page and implement logic to navigate through pages.
Data Display: Log the data for the current page to the console.
Simulated Delay: Mimic a network delay using setTimeout to simulate asynchronous loading.
