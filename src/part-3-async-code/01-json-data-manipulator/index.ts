/*
JSON Data Manipulator
Overview
Create a script that reads a local JSON file, manipulates the data, and then saves the results back to a new JSON file. 
The goal is to practice using asynchronous operations to handle file reading and writing, along with data transformations.

Key Features
Load a JSON file using fetch.
Transform the data (e.g., filter, map, reduce).
Save the manipulated data to a new JSON file (you may simulate saving by logging to the console or using a downloadable Blob).
