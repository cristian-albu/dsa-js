# Part 5: Chess

Build a game of chess with some extra details to show that you've learned.
Organize this however you want.

Rules & notes:

- You must use OOP
- You play both sides
- Check everything that can happen in chess that you might not be fammiliar with like "En passant", "pins", "discovered check", etc.
- Must have a timer functionality. You should be able to configure before you start the game the time control. 3min + 1s per move, 10min no bonus time, etc.
- You should have a snapshot of the game at every move and a history of all of the moves. You should make a request to a fake server with each move with the relevant data.
- You must have a text editor where you can paste games based on their chess standard notation. That includes the text parser built from scratch.
- Comment the design patterns you decide to use
- Write tests
