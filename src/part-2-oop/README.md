# Part 2: OOP - Object Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain both data (in the form of fields or attributes) and methods (functions or procedures associated with the object). OOP focuses on structuring software around objects and their interactions, rather than actions or logic.

The core principles of OOP are:

- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. This hides the internal state of the object and exposes only the necessary functionality, promoting modularity and protecting the data from external modification.

- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on real-world objects or concepts, exposing only the essential details and hiding the complexity. This allows for focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.

- **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behavior from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy between objects.

- **Polymorphism**: The ability of different objects to respond to the same method in different ways, typically through method overriding (changing inherited behavior) or method overloading (same method name, different parameter types). This allows for more flexible and dynamic code execution.

Key Concepts in OOP:

- **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the data attributes and methods that the objects of the class will have.
- **Object**: An instance of a class that contains real values instead of placeholders defined in the class.
- **Method**: A function that defines the behavior of the objects created from a class.
- **Attribute/Field**: Variables that hold the data associated with an object.

## Methodology and structure:

1. Read the comments cause they contain the requirements.
2. Organize your exercise in existing file or make multiple files.
3. Include tests.
4. Add any features that might appear useful.
