/*
Project: Simple Bank Account System
Overview
In this project, you’ll create different types of bank accounts (e.g., SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount). 
Each account will have basic operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks. 
You’ll use inheritance to differentiate between account types and encapsulate the account balance and actions.

Key Features
Create a base BankAccount class.
Create specific account types like SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount using inheritance.
Encapsulate account details (like balance) and provide methods like deposit(), withdraw(), and getBalance().
Use polymorphism to handle different types of withdrawals or interest calculations depending on the account type.
