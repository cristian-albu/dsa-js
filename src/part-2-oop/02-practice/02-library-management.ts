Project: Simple Library Management System
Overview
In this project, you'll create a system where a library can manage books, track borrowed books, and return books. Different types of users (e.g., Member, Librarian) can interact with the system. You can model classes for books, members, and the library itself.

Key Features
Base Class: Book

Encapsulate book details like title, author, ISBN, availability status.
Inheritance: User Classes

Create a base User class with subclasses like Member and Librarian. Members can borrow books, and librarians can manage the inventory.
Encapsulation & Abstraction

Encapsulate the logic of borrowing and returning books.
Abstract away the complexity of managing book availability.
Polymorphism

Use polymorphism to allow different behaviors for users. For example, a Member can borrow a book, but only a Librarian can add or remove books from the system.
