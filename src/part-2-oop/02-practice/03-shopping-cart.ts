/* 
Project: Simple Shopping Cart
Overview (continued)
You will create a shopping cart system where users can:

Add items to the cart.
Remove items from the cart.
Display all items in the cart.
Calculate the total price of the items.
You can also extend this project with inheritance to create different product types, such as 
Electronics, Clothing, and Grocery, each with its own specific behavior (e.g., a discount for 
electronics or a special tax for groceries).
