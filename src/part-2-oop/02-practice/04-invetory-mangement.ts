/*
Project: Inventory Management System
Overview
You will create a system that manages products in an inventory. Each product has attributes like name, price, quantity, and category. The system will allow you to add products, update their quantities, track low-stock products, and generate a summary of the inventory.

Key Features
Base Product Class: Define a Product class that holds common product attributes (e.g., name, price, quantity).

Inheritance for Different Product Types: Create subclasses like Electronics, Perishables, and Clothing, each with specific behaviors (e.g., Perishables might have an expiration date).

Encapsulation: Encapsulate the details of the product attributes, with methods to add, remove, and update inventory items.

Polymorphism: Use polymorphism to handle product-specific actions, like restocking or checking expiration for perishable items.

Inventory Management Class: Create an Inventory class to manage multiple Product objects. This class will handle adding, removing, and displaying product information.
