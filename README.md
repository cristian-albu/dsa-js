# Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript/TypeScript

Learn data structures and algorithms with typescript while also practicing and writing tests.

#### Methodology and structure:

1. Get the book "Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript" by Michael McMillan.
2. Read one chapte at a time.
3. During each chapter go to the `examples` directory of that chapter and recreate the examples and important notes in `index.ts`
4. Go to the `exercises` directory and find between 5-20 exercises that are relevant to that chapter. Create a new directory for each with the name of the exercise.
5. Create a file `index.ts` and a test file `index.test.ts` in each exercise directory.
6. Write a test suite for the exercises.
7. Solve each exercise.

Notes: Each exercise should be attempted for at least 20-30 minutes before looking at the chapter examples. Only after another 20-30 minutes of struggle you should look for outside help (stackoverflow, friends?, chatgpt, etc...)

Run `npm install` to start
Run `npm test` to run all test files
Run `npx jest [path-to-file]` to run a specific test or install an extension for ease of use
